# Architectural Constraints and Assumptions

## Assumptions Made for Architecture Design

### 1. AWS Region and Compliance
- **Region**: US-East-1 (Virginia) - Most cost-effective with full service availability
- **Compliance**: Basic security best practices, no specific compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Data Residency**: No specific geographic restrictions

### 2. User Scale and Performance
- **Initial Team Size**: 20-50 users
- **Expected Growth**: 100-200 users within 12 months
- **Peak Concurrent Users**: 20-30 users
- **Response Time**: < 5 seconds for AI queries, < 2 seconds for document operations
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime target (standard business hours focus)

### 3. Document Volume and Processing
- **Initial Document Count**: 100-500 documents
- **Expected Growth**: 1000-2000 documents within 12 months
- **Average Document Size**: 1-5 MB per document
- **Maximum Document Size**: 10 MB per document
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT, common code files

### 4. Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Email/password with secure session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access (basic user roles)
- **Data Encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Network Security**: HTTPS only, secure API endpoints
- **No MFA Required**: For MVP simplicity
- **No External Identity Provider**: Self-contained authentication

### 5. Budget and Cost Optimization
- **Cost Priority**: Balanced approach - optimize for development speed while maintaining reasonable costs
- **Service Selection**: Use managed AWS services to reduce operational overhead
- **Scaling Strategy**: Start small, scale based on actual usage

### 6. Technology Stack Preferences
- **Frontend**: React.js - Modern, widely adopted, good ecosystem
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express - JavaScript consistency, good AWS SDK support
- **Database**: DynamoDB - Serverless, scalable, cost-effective for MVP
- **Storage**: S3 - Standard choice for document storage
- **AI Platform**: Amazon Bedrock - As specified in requirements

### 7. Operations and Monitoring
- **Monitoring**: Basic CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
- **Logging**: CloudWatch Logs with 30-day retention
- **Backup**: Automated S3 and DynamoDB backups
- **Deployment**: Simple CI/CD with AWS services
- **Environment Strategy**: Development and Production environments

## Architectural Constraints

### Performance Constraints
- AI response time: < 5 seconds
- Document upload: < 30 seconds for 10MB files
- Concurrent user support: 30 users minimum
- Database query response: < 1 second

### Security Constraints
- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Secure authentication and session management
- API rate limiting and input validation
- No sensitive data in logs or error messages

### Scalability Constraints
- Horizontal scaling capability for web tier
- Database design must support growth to 10,000+ documents
- Storage design must support TB-scale document storage
- AI processing must handle multiple concurrent requests

### Cost Constraints
- Optimize for pay-as-you-use AWS services
- Minimize always-on infrastructure costs
- Use serverless where appropriate
- Implement cost monitoring and alerts

### Technology Constraints
- Must use Amazon Bedrock for AI processing
- Must be deployable on AWS
- Must support modern web browsers
- Must be mobile-responsive

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: AI response times exceed 5 seconds
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching, optimize document chunking, use appropriate Bedrock models

### Security Risks
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to documents
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and audit logging

### Scalability Risks
- **Risk**: System cannot handle user growth
- **Mitigation**: Use auto-scaling services, design for horizontal scaling

### Cost Risks
- **Risk**: AWS costs exceed budget expectations
- **Mitigation**: Implement cost monitoring, use reserved instances where appropriate, optimize resource usage

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- System availability: > 99.5%
- Average response time: < 3 seconds
- Document processing success rate: > 95%
- User authentication success rate: > 99%

### Business Metrics
- User adoption rate: > 80% of team members
- Daily active users: > 50% of registered users
- Document upload rate: > 10 documents per week
- Query success rate: > 90% user satisfaction
