# System Architecture Development Plan

## Project Overview
Creating a comprehensive system architecture for the AI-powered software development assistance system based on the user stories defined in the 01_user_stories directory.

## Architecture Scope
Based on the MVP requirements:
- Document upload and storage system
- AI-powered Q&A using Amazon Bedrock
- User authentication and session management
- Modern web-based chat interface
- Security implementation at all levels
- Support for 10+ concurrent users

## Plan Steps

  - [x] State management design
  - [x] Responsive design patterns

### Phase 4: Technical Specifications
- [x] **Step 4.1**: Create detailed technical specifications
  - [x] API endpoint specifications
  - [x] Database schema definitions
  - [x] Security implementation details
  - [x] Error handling and logging specifications
- [x] **Step 4.2**: Define deployment and infrastructure
  - [x] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach
  - [x] CI/CD pipeline design
  - [x] Environment configuration (dev, staging, prod)
  - [x] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [x] **Step 4.3**: Create implementation guidelines
  - [x] Development standards and best practices
  - [x] Code organization and structure
  - [x] Testing strategy and requirements
  - [x] Performance optimization guidelines

### Phase 5: Documentation & Review
- [x] **Step 5.1**: Create comprehensive architecture documentation
  - [x] System architecture overview
  - [x] Component interaction diagrams
  - [x] Security architecture documentation
  - [x] Deployment and operations guide
- [x] **Step 5.2**: Review and validation
  - [x] Architecture review against user stories
  - [x] Security review and validation
  - [x] Performance and scalability review
  - [x] Stakeholder review and approval - Updated with Cognito integration

## Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding with the architecture design, I need clarification on the following:

1. **AWS Region Preference**: 
   - Which AWS region should be used for deployment?
   - Any specific compliance or data residency requirements?

2. **User Scale Expectations**:
   - Current team size that will use the system?
   - Expected growth in the next 6-12 months?
   - Peak concurrent usage expectations?

3. **Document Volume and Types**:
   - Expected number of documents to be uploaded initially?
   - Average document size expectations?
   - Any specific document processing requirements beyond basic text extraction?

4. **Security Requirements**:
   - Any specific compliance requirements (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)?
   - Multi-factor authentication required?
   - Any integration with existing identity providers (Active Directory, SAML, etc.)?

5. **Budget and Cost Constraints**:
   - Any specific budget limitations for AWS services?
   - Preference for cost optimization vs. performance?

6. **Frontend Technology Preference**:
   - Any preference for frontend framework (React, Vue, Angular)?
   - Mobile responsiveness requirements?
   - Accessibility compliance level needed?

7. **Monitoring and Operations**:
   - Required monitoring and alerting level?
   - Log retention requirements?
   - Backup and disaster recovery expectations?

## Architecture Deliverables

Upon completion, the following documents will be created:

1. **02_system_architecture_overview.md** - High-level system architecture
2. **03_aws_services_integration.md** - AWS services design and integration
3. **04_data_models_and_storage.md** - DynamoDB schemas and S3 structure
4. **05_api_design_and_bedrock_integration.md** - API specifications and Bedrock patterns
5. **06_frontend_architecture.md** - Modern UI architecture and design
6. **07_security_architecture.md** - Comprehensive security design
7. **08_deployment_and_infrastructure.md** - Infrastructure and deployment guide
8. **09_implementation_guidelines.md** - Development standards and best practices
