- **Deliverable**: Complete MVP ready for user testing

## Implementation Guidelines

### Frontend Development
```typescript
// Key technologies and patterns
- React 18 with TypeScript
- AWS Amplify for Cognito integration
- Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Query for API state management
- WebSocket for real-time chat features
```

### Backend Development
```typescript
// Key technologies and patterns
- Node.js 18 with TypeScript
- Serverless Framework for deployment
- AWS SDK v3 for service integration
- Structured logging with CloudWatch
- Error handling and retry logic
```

### Infrastructure as Code
```yaml
# Deployment approach
- Serverless Framework for Lambda functions
- CloudFormation for AWS resources
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated testing and deployment
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Authentication Success Rate**: > 99%
- **API Response Time**: < 3 seconds average
- **Document Processing Time**: < 2 minutes per document
- **System Availability**: > 99.5% uptime
- **Error Rate**: < 1% of all requests

### Business Metrics
