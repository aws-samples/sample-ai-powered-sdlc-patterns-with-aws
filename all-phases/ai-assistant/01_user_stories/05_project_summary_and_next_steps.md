   - Set up version control and CI/CD pipeline

2. **Team Preparation:**
   - Review user stories with development team
   - Assign story ownership for Sprint 1
   - Set up project tracking (Jira/similar)

### Sprint Planning
1. **Sprint 1 Planning:**
   - Detailed technical design for infrastructure
   - Database schema design
   - Authentication system architecture
   - Set up development standards and code review process

2. **Stakeholder Communication:**
   - Share user stories with key stakeholders
   - Schedule regular demo sessions
   - Set up feedback collection process

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
1. **Advanced Integrations:** Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Slack
2. **ITOps Automation:** Automated task execution through chat

4. **Team Collaboration:** Shared conversations and knowledge
5. **Advanced Search:** Filtering, categorization, and advanced queries
6. **Prompt Library:** Reusable prompts for common tasks
7. **Analytics:** Usage analytics and system optimization

## Questions for Clarification
Before development begins, please confirm:

1. **Team Size:** How many team members will be using the system initially?

2. **Document Volume:** Approximately how many documents do you expect to upload initially?

3. **Timeline Flexibility:** Are the 2-week sprint estimates acceptable, or do you need faster delivery?

## Conclusion
The user stories provide a solid foundation for developing an MVP that delivers core value quickly while setting up for future enhancements. The focus on document upload and AI-powered Q&A addresses the primary use case while maintaining simplicity for rapid development and deployment.
