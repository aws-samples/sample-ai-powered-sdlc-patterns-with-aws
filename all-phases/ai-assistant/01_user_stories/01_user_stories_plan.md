# User Stories Development Plan

## Project Overview
Creating user stories for an AI-powered software development assistance system that enables different personas to ask questions about development guidelines, SOPs, and team knowledge.

## Plan Steps

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Clarification
- [x] **Step 1.1**: Identify and define user personas
  - [x] Define primary personas (developers, architects, project managers, etc.)
  - [x] Understand their specific needs and pain points
  - *Completed: All personas will use the system*
- [x] **Step 1.2**: Clarify system boundaries and integration requirements
  - [x] Define which existing tools/systems need integration
  - [x] Understand current workflow and pain points
  - *Completed: Basic integration with standard SDLC tools*
- [x] **Step 1.3**: Define MVP scope and success criteria
  - [x] Prioritize core features for MVP
  - [x] Define what "upload files and generate questions" means specifically
  - *Completed: Users ask questions about uploaded content*

### Phase 2: User Story Creation
- [x] **Step 2.1**: Create Epic-level stories
  - [x] Knowledge Management Epic
  - [x] Question & Answer Epic
  - [x] User Interface Epic
  - [x] System Foundation Epic
- [x] **Step 2.2**: Break down epics into detailed user stories
  - [x] Write stories following standard format (As a... I want... So that...)
  - [x] Include acceptance criteria for each story
  - [x] Add story points estimation
- [x] **Step 2.3**: Prioritize stories for MVP
  - [x] Focus on file upload and question generation
  - [x] Identify dependencies between stories

### Phase 3: Documentation & Review
- [x] **Step 3.1**: Create user story documentation
  - [x] Document all user stories with numbering system
  - [x] Include wireframes/mockups if needed
  - [x] Add technical considerations
- [x] **Step 3.2**: Review and validation
  - [x] Internal review of stories
  - [ ] Stakeholder review and approval
  - [ ] Refinement based on feedback

## Clarifying Questions Needed

   - What formats are expected? (PDF, Word, Markdown, code files, etc.)
   ALL

   - How large is the expected knowledge base?
   Medium

3. **Question Generation**:
