|------|-------|
| Bugs | 0 |
| Vulnerabilities | 0 |
| Code Smells | 12 |
| Security Hotspots | 2 |

## Code Smells Details

1. **Minor**: Use explicit types instead of 'var' when the type is not obvious (5 occurrences)
2. **Minor**: Remove unused imports (3 occurrences)
3. **Minor**: Add missing @Override annotations (2 occurrences)
4. **Info**: Add a private constructor to hide the implicit public one (1 occurrence)
5. **Info**: Rename this field to match the regular expression "^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$" (1 occurrence)

## Security Hotspots

1. **Medium**: Make sure using a dynamically formatted SQL query is safe here (ProductRepository.java:45)
2. **Low**: Make sure that using this pseudorandom number generator is safe here (ProductService.java:112)

## Modern Java Features Used

| Feature | Usage Count | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Records | 1 | GOOD |
