1. Tomcat Embed Core (KEV - Known Exploited) - FIXED ‚úÖ
2. Maven Core - FIXED ‚úÖ
3. Maven Shared Utils - FIXED ‚úÖ

### High Severity Vulnerabilities

**OWASP**: ‚úÖ None found  
**Grype**: ‚úÖ **0 High Severity Issues** (Previously 9, now resolved)
- 4 Spring Framework vulnerabilities - FIXED ‚úÖ
- 4 Tomcat Embed Core vulnerabilities - FIXED ‚úÖ
- 1 Commons library vulnerability - FIXED ‚úÖ

### Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

**OWASP**: ‚úÖ 0 (Previously 2, now resolved)
- Spring Core (Fixed ‚úÖ)
- H2 Database (Fixed ‚úÖ)

**Grype**: ‚úÖ **0 Medium Severity Issues** (Previously 15, now resolved)
- Multiple Tomcat, Spring, and library vulnerabilities - FIXED ‚úÖ

- Commons and logging framework issues - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Key Differences Explained

### 1. Detection Scope
- **OWASP**: Focuses on known CVEs in dependency databases
- **Grype**: Uses broader vulnerability sources and more aggressive detection

### 2. Risk Assessment
- **OWASP**: Traditional CVSS scoring
- **Grype**: Modern EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) + KEV data

### 3. Database Coverage
- **OWASP**: Primarily NVD and GitHub advisories
- **Grype**: Multiple sources including GitHub, Alpine, Ubuntu, etc.

### 4. Vulnerability Age
- **OWASP**: May miss newer vulnerabilities
- **Grype**: More up-to-date vulnerability database

## Why Such Different Initial Results?

### 1. **Database Freshness**
- Grype appears to have more recent vulnerability data
- OWASP may not have detected some newer CVEs

### 2. **Detection Methodology**
- Grype scans the actual JAR contents more thoroughly
- OWASP relies more on declared dependencies

### 3. **Vulnerability Sources**
- Grype aggregates from multiple security databases
- OWASP primarily uses NVD and GitHub

### 4. **Risk Prioritization**
- Grype includes EPSS scores (exploitation probability)
- Grype flags Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)

## Successful Remediation Actions

### 1. **Addressed Critical KEV Vulnerability**
   ```bash
   # Updated Tomcat Embed Core to 10.1.42
   # Successfully eliminated the actively exploited vulnerability
   ```

### 2. **Updated Spring Framework**
   ```xml
   <spring-boot.version>3.3.11</spring-boot.version>
   <spring-framework.version>6.1.21</spring-framework.version>
   ```

### 3. **Updated Maven Dependencies**
   ```xml
   <maven.version>3.9.9</maven.version>
   <maven-shared-utils.version>3.4.2</maven-shared-utils.version>
   ```

### Tool Strategy Recommendations

1. **Use Both Tools**
   - OWASP for baseline compliance
   - Grype for comprehensive security assessment

2. **Prioritize Grype Findings**
   - Focus on KEV vulnerabilities first
   - Address high EPSS scores (>90%)

3. **Implement in CI/CD**
   ```yaml
   # Example GitHub Action
   - name: Run Grype vulnerability scanner
     uses: anchore/scan-action@v3
     with:
       image: "your-app:latest"
       fail-build: "high"
   ```

## Updated Security Status

### Before (Initial Scan)
```
üö® Critical: 3 (including 1 KEV)
‚ö†Ô∏è High: 9
üìã Medium: 15
‚ÑπÔ∏è Low: 4
Status: "High Risk - Immediate Action Required"
```

### After (Final Scan)
```
‚úÖ Critical: 0
‚úÖ High: 0
‚úÖ Medium: 0
‚úÖ Low: 0
Status: "Secure - All Vulnerabilities Resolved"
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Multiple Tool Approach**
- Using both OWASP and Grype provides comprehensive coverage
- Different tools catch different vulnerabilities

### 2. **Modern Risk Assessment**
- EPSS scores help prioritize vulnerabilities based on exploitation probability
- KEV data identifies active threats requiring immediate attention

### 3. **Comprehensive Scanning**
- JAR-level scanning reveals more vulnerabilities
- Both source code and dependencies need thorough scanning

## Ongoing Security Plan

### Phase 1: Maintain Security
- [x] Update Tomcat Embed Core to 10.1.42
- [x] Update Maven to 3.9.9
- [x] Update Spring Boot to 3.3.11
- [x] Update all Spring Framework components to 6.1.21
- [x] Update Commons libraries to latest versions

### Phase 2: Process Improvement
- [ ] Implement Grype in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Establish regular scanning schedule
- [ ] Monitor KEV catalog for new threats
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates

## Conclusion

The comparison reveals that **using both OWASP Dependency Check and Grype provides the most comprehensive security assessment**. While OWASP is good for compliance and basic vulnerability detection, **Grype provides a more detailed security picture with better risk prioritization**.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **All 31 vulnerabilities** have been successfully resolved
2. **KEV vulnerability** has been eliminated, removing the immediate real-world threat
3. **EPSS scores** helped prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities
4. **Multiple tools** are necessary for complete security coverage

**Recommendation**: Continue using Grype as the primary security scanner while maintaining OWASP for compliance reporting.
