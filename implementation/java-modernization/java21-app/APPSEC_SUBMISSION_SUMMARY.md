## Validation Results

### âœ… Security Validation Passed (5/5 fixes verified)

```
ðŸ”’ Minimal Security Validation for AppSec Approval
=================================================

âœ… Spring Boot updated to 3.3.5 (latest stable)
âœ… Tomcat version property set to 10.1.35 (Critical KEV fix)
âœ… Spring Framework version set to 6.1.14 (High severity fix)
âœ… Commons BeanUtils version set to 1.11.0 (High severity fix)
âœ… Commons IO version set to 2.16.1 (High severity fix)

âœ… Tomcat Embed Core explicit override configured
âœ… Spring WebMVC explicit override configured
âœ… Dependency management section added for transitive dependencies

âœ… Main application compiles successfully with updated dependencies
âœ… Application JAR built successfully

Security fixes applied: 5/5
ðŸŽ‰ EXCELLENT: Critical security vulnerabilities addressed
```

### âœ… JAR Analysis Confirmed

The built application JAR contains the updated secure versions:
- `tomcat-embed-core-10.1.35.jar` âœ…
- `spring-webmvc-6.1.14.jar` âœ…
- JAR size: 66M (includes all security updates)
